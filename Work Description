This program uses a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of the connected components in the network. It starts by initializing each workstation as a separate component. Then, it iterates over the given connections and unions the sets of workstations connected by each connection. Finally, it counts the number of cables required to connect all the components together.
The program outputs the minimum number of cables required to make all the workstations connected. If it is not possible to connect all the workstations, it outputs -1. In the provided example, the output is 1, indicating that one cable needs to be moved to make all workstations connected.
